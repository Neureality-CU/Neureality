		<div class="faq-item">
			<h2 class="FAQ_Q"><span class="colortext">Overview</span></h2>

			<p class="answer">This track serves as an innovative blend of neuroscience and gaming in the hackathon. Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) gaming is at the cutting edge of interactive entertainment, enabling players to control game mechanics using their brain signals. This task challenges participants to transform a provided first-person shooter VR game into a fully functional BCI-enabled game, incorporating Motor Imagery (MI), Steady-State Visually Evoked Potentials (SSVEP), and Electromyography (EMG) as control mechanisms.

			<h2 class="FAQ_Q"><span class="colortext">Objective</span></h2>
			<p class="answer">Capture and Preprocess BCI Signals: Utilize the tools we provide to capture and preprocess brain-computer interface (BCI) signals.
			</p>

			<p class="answer">Decoder Development: Considering the time constraints, it's understandable if you cannot incorporate all three modalities into the final game. Aim to develop decoders for all three, but include only the ones you are confident with in the final product.
</p>
			<p class="answer">Integration of BCI Modalities: Ensure smooth integration of decoders into the game, allowing reliable translation of brain and muscle signals into actions. Focus on communication between the decoder system and the game for quick, accurate responses.
			</p>

			<p class="answer">User-Friendly Gaming Experience: Endeavor to design the game to be as user-friendly as possible, featuring intuitive BCI controls. Focus on simplifying the interface and interactions to ensure they are easy to understand.
</p>



		</div>

		<div class="faq-item">
			<h2 class="FAQ_Q"><span class="colortext">Deliverables</span></h2>
			<p class="answer">Code Repositories: Submit a link to a public repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) with the complete source code for the BCI-enabled game. This includes all custom scripts and libraries. Ensure the repository has a detailed README file with instructions for setting up, installing, and running the game. Highlight how you implemented BCI technologies.
</p>
			<p class="answer">Fully Functional BCI-Enabled Game: Provide a complete, playable version of the first-person shooter VR game, now with BCI functionality. It should incorporate at least one of the following for game controls: Motor Imagery, SSVEP, or Electromyography (EMG). Include instructions for download or access, and a user guide for BCI input navigation.
</p>
			<p class="answer">Demo Video: Create a demo video showing your game in action, focusing on player interaction with BCI controls.</p>
		<p class="answer">Technical and Design Documentation: Submit a comprehensive document detailing your game's technical architecture, the rationale behind your BCI modality choices, and your integration strategy. Include an analysis and description of your efforts with decoders not featured in the final game, documenting both the testing process and the insights gained.

		<div class="faq-item">
			<h2 class="FAQ_Q"><span class="colortext">Judging Criteria</span></h2>
			<p class="answer">Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
Effort and Exploration: Evaluation will acknowledge the diligence in attempting to include, develop, and test various decoder types, irrespective of the actual number incorporated into the final product.

Actual Implementation and Effectiveness: The evaluation will also focus on the decoders that are ultimately integrated into the final game, examining the diversity and types of decoders used. Additionally, their effectiveness, in terms of responsiveness and precision in converting brain signals to game actions, will be assessed.

Integration and Compatibility: The effectiveness of the decoder system's integration into the game and the quality of its communication design are being evaluated. This includes assessing how smoothly the decoders function together to deliver a cohesive gaming experience.

User Experience and Usability: The overall enjoyment and engagement of the game, including how interesting and fun it is to play, alongside player comfort during gameplay, will be assessed. This evaluates the game's ability to captivate and maintain player interest while ensuring ease of use and accessibility.

Innovation: The originality and creativity of the solution, including the inventive ways BCI is integrated into VR gaming, are evaluated. Thoughtful and considerate modifications to the original game to optimally adapt it for BCI purposes are also taken into account, highlighting creative adjustments that enhance the fit between the game and BCI technology.
